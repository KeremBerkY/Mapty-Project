## Description

When we enter the application, we are shown our live location at the very beginning. When we click on any place on the map, a pop-up window appears. We can choose whether to go there on foot or by bicycle. After that we enter the distances, duration and cadence. By pressing enter, we calculate how fast we should move based on distance and duration. All data is stored in memory.

#### Technologies
